🎉 **Just Launched My Latest Project!** 🎉

I'm excited to share my new **Interactive Product Viewer** app, built using **React** and **CSS**. This project allows users to view, favorite, and explore product details in an interactive and visually appealing way. It was a fun project to work on, and I can't wait for you to try it!

### 🔑 **Key Features:**

- **Product Display Cards:** View multiple products with their names, prices, descriptions, and images.
- **Toggle Favorite:** Favorite/unfavorite products with a heart icon, dynamically updating the UI.
- **Expand/Collapse Features:** Show or hide product features by clicking a button.
- **Filter and Clear Favorites:** View only favorited products or remove all products from the favorite state with a single click.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Products that are favorited are styled differently for better visibility.

### 💻 **Technologies:**

- **React:** Developed a smooth, interactive user experience.
- **CSS:** Used basic styling to make the product cards visually appealing.
- **State Management with React Hooks:** Managed dynamic product states like favoriting and expanding features efficiently.
